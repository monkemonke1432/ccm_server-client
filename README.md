# ccm_server-client
ComputerCraft Messenger but with a Server/Client relationship. Wired, one computer acts as a server and the rest are clients.

Q/A:
Q: Is this also vibecoded?
A: Yes, same model, still ashamed.
Q: Does this work with wireless/ender modems?
A: Yes! Works with any modem, you just need a separate wired/wireless server since it can't use multiple modems at once.
