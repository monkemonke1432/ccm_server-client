# ccm_server-client
ComputerCraft Messenger but with a Server/Client relationship. Wired, one computer acts as a server and the rest are clients.

FYI, this is the ***working*** version. This is recommended to be used instead of https://github.com/monkemonke1432/computercraftmessenger which is confirmed to NOT work.

Q/A:

Q: Is this also vibecoded?

A: Yes, same model, still ashamed.

Q: Does this work with wireless/ender modems?

A: Yes! Works with any modem, you just need a separate wired/wireless server since it can't use multiple modems at once.

Q: Why not just add this code to https://github.com/monkemonke1432/computercraftmessenger ?

A: idk
